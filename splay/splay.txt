Rotations in Splay Tree
Zig Rotation   ---> right rotaion 
Zag Rotation   ---> left rotation
Zig – Zig Rotation
Zag – Zag Rotation
Zig – Zag Rotation
Zag – Zig Rotation


Zig Rotation: If a node has a right child, perform a right rotation to bring it to the root. If it has a left child, perform a left rotation.

Zig-Zig Rotation: If a node has a grandchild that is also its child’s right or left child, perform a double rotation to balance the tree. 
For example, if the node has a right child and the right child has a left child, perform a right-left rotation. 
If the node has a left child and the left child has a right child, perform a left-right rotation.

Note: The specific implementation details, including the exact rotations used, may vary depending on the exact form of the splay tree.
